        HTML is the standard language used to create webpages. It provides the structure for the content that is displayed on the web. Using HTML, we can add text, links, images, and other elements to build a complete webpage.

        A basic HTML document consists of tags that define the structure. The document starts with a `<html>` tag, followed by a `<head>` tag for meta-information and a `<body>` tag, which contains the visible content of the page.

        Web developers use HTML in order to combination with other technologies like CSS or C++(Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to enhance the design and functionality of websites. CSS is used for styling, while JavaScript adds interactivity.

        Learning HTML is the first step toward becoming a good web developer. It allows you to create static webpages, which can then be made dynamic with CSS and JavaScript. Once you understand the basics of HTML, you can move on to more advanced topics like web accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).
